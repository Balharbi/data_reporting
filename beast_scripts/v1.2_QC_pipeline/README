Pipeline to combine primer order files into one file with F and R 
then input data from qPCR melt curve
Compare with calculated values and give output 

v1.2
====
QC_1.1_checkOrdered.sh this file is to be run instead of QC_1_combinePrimerPlates.sh

1.	In this version, the coa.csv file from IDT if consulted against the designed primersets
2.	Then combined into primer_plate_1,2,etc

QC_2.1_AmpliconManifest_Checker.sh is to be run instead of QC_2_AmpliconManifest_Checker.sh

1.	In this version, the Temp calculated has a primer plate ID
2. 	This makes sure that the primers tested are actually ordered

QC_3.1_qPCRmeltTemp3.sh is to be run instead of QC_3_qPCRmeltTemp3.sh

1. 	This reads one or two plates (need to toggle secondplate swtich)
2.	Updates script to read file from new qPCR machine output of melt curve

QC_3.2_qPCRmeltTemp3.sh is to be run instead of QC_3.1_qPCRmeltTemp3.sh
when there is only one plate and that is primerplate2 only (rather inelegant solution)
also parses out the qPCR file into one separate melt temp files based on name

Save qPCR melt temp outfile cut and paste into SAnnn-QC

QC_4_Temp_Corr.R
1.	The R script that generates the correlation file is updated to run better and output total amplicons
2.	Updated to output the failed well nos as well as well with duplicate primers 

QC_4.1_Temp_Corr.R
1. 	upgrade to ggplot and dynamic labels (with pearson correlation)

QC_PlateMap.pdf
1. 	This is the plate map which is used to generate the primer mappings

Temp_cal.sh
1.	This generates the calculated Temp and adds a primer plate and well ID
2.	In the format (FS="_") Tm=$4, then FS="=", $2
3.	Shared_chr20_31940471_Tm=81.9_Length=154_ID=DAH_primer_plate2:F03


v1.0
====
1. QC_1_combinePrimerPlates.sh
takes the .csv primer order files and combine them into one file
96wellposName			Forward	(With adaptors)					Reverse (with adaptors)						Primer plate name
H12     Shared_chr20_31940471   TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGTGTCGGTCTCATGTGATTACC GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCATCGCGTAGGACAGAATTAGG        DAH_primer_plate2


2. QC_2_AmpliconManifest_Checker.sh
uses the amplicon generated by summary.html and primer sequences generated by the respective order files with well number (from the output of the script QC_combinePrimerPlates.sh)

The output of the this script is /home/dyap/dyap_temp/Temp_cal-input
Shared_chr10_78907562 

CACATGGCCCCAACTTTTCCTCCTGCCTGATGTCTGGACCCACAGGGGACAGATGGTGGTCCCTGGTCACTGAAGTACCCACAGGTTTGATTATTGAGACTTTTATCTCTGTTGACTACAGGGAGGACCTGAATCAGTTTACATGGTTAAAATAAAAGCGCCATATACAAGGATAAAGCA 
DAH_primer_plate2:F03

Format Name<tab>Sequence-in-upper-case<tab>Plate:well-ID

This then calls Temp_cal.sh (in the same directory, runs from within the script)
(which calculates the Tm of the amplicon and which reads the input file and generates the output file /home/dyap/dyap_temp/Temp_cal-output
in the format (FS="_") Tm=$4, then FS="=", $2
Shared_chr20_31940471_Tm=81.9_Length=154

3. QC_3_qPCRmeltTemp3.sh
This is the one that was modified to take a generic plate qPCR
Script to map qPCR plate with primer plate and also with the amplicon name, length as well as calculated Tm

4. /home/dyap/Projects/R/R-scripts/Rscript3 QC_4_Temp_Corr.R (change Project name in the file itself)
R script to read in the calculated and obtained Tms of amplicons and plot PDF graphs for QC purposes
