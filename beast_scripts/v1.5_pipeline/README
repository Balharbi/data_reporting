This is the version for the backup generation of primers for the review of Eirew et al 2012
This is only the backup version

Basically a v0 design ie position based (using REF sequences not taking into consideration
any SNV/SNP or indels)

should upgrade web version of the pipeline to run this when ported to Pleiades which can run command-line
in silico PCR. Need to add safe guards to prevent overloading system / multiple submission etc.
