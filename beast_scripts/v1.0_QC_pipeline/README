Pipeline to combine primer order files into one file with F and R 
then input data from qPCR melt curve
Compare with calculated values and give output 

v1.0
====
1. QC_1_combinePrimerPlates.sh
takes the .csv primer order files and combine them into one file
96wellposName			Forward	(With adaptors)					Reverse (with adaptors)						Primer plate name

2. QC_2_AmpliconManifest_Checker.sh
uses the amplicon generated by summary.html and primer sequences generated by the respective order files with well number (from the output of the script QC_combinePrimerPlates.sh)

The output of the this script is /home/dyap/dyap_temp/Temp_cal-input
Shared_chr10_78907562

DAH_primer_plate2:F03

This then calls Temp_cal.sh (in the same directory, runs from within the script)
(which calculates the Tm of the amplicon and which reads the input file and generates the output file /home/dyap/dyap_temp/Temp_cal-output
in the format (FS="_") Tm=$4, then FS="=", $2
Shared_chr20_31940471_Tm=81.9_Length=154

3. QC_3_qPCRmeltTemp3.sh
This is the one that was modified to take a generic plate qPCR
Script to map qPCR plate with primer plate and also with the amplicon name, length as well as calculated Tm

4. /home/dyap/Projects/R/R-scripts/Rscript3 QC_4_Temp_Corr.R (change Project name in the file itself)
R script to read in the calculated and obtained Tms of amplicons and plot PDF graphs for QC purposes
