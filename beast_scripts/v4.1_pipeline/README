v4.1
####
This pipeline is based on v3.2 which takes positions but no DNA seq input
Fixed version v4.1_pipeline_14_04_01.tgz

Changelog
========
1. Generates primer3 input using new format (incl N masked DNA Seq, ref, alt & remarks) 
   - in SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE+ & P3_COMMENT= fields, respectively
2. Runs primer3 with v4.1 settings and also reiterates GC_CLAMP=0
3. Display pipeline upgraded and works
4. context derived from input sequence (5' 10bp from position of interest, SNV or 1st indel base)
5. Generates the manifest in new format for new pipeline.


v3.2 (generates primer3 output)
